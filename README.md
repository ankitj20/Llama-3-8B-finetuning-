# Llama-3-8B-finetuning-

In this project I fine tuned the Llama model to increase its mathematical reasoning capability, I used unsloth library to do this, and achieve a 10 percent improvement on Minerva Math pre algebra, and 5 percent improvement on Minerva Math geometry. I used MetaMathQA-40K dataset to fine tune this.
